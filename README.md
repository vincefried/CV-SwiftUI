Why use a document editor and fiddle around with layout when you're an iOS developer and can create layouts in SwiftUI?
Some years ago, I had this idea to create my CV in SwiftUI and it was so much fun that I decided to keep it.
It allows me to easily adjust contents on a data level while playing around with SwiftUI functionalities and showcasing my work in a creative way.
